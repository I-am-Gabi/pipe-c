# C PIPE

This is the code make for Posix Class, a small set of code to handle with process
and pipe.

## How to build

See `CMakeLists.txt` for the build scripts.

To build the command line example, simply run `cmake .` and `make`
at the command line in the current directory.

By default, this will generate an executable called whatever `exe`
is bound to in `CMakeLists.txt`.
To then run the program run in the project directory:

```
./exe
```
